# vim-vnicode

Simple Vim plugin that shows Unicode character under the cursor. Works just
like <kbd>g</kbd><kbd>a</kbd>. You can even search Unicode character by its name. Thatâ€™s it.

## Quick Start

Before you start using plugin you may want to acquire needed Unicode data
files. Run `make` then `make gzip` or `make xz` if you want to compress them.
See `:h vnicode-datafiles` for more.

Type <kbd>g</kbd><kbd>a</kbd>, <kbd>g</kbd><kbd>8</kbd>, <kbd>g</kbd><kbd>A</kbd>.
