INTRO							*vnicode-intro*

==============================================================================
MAPPINGS
							*vnicode-mappings*
Following mappings are provided only if they are currently unmapped.

ga		Show character under the cursor just like |ga|.

		When UnicodeData.txt or NameAliases.txt is available among
		data files Unicode character names will also be shown. See
		|vnicode-datafiles| for setup.

		Uses |:Unicode| under the hood.

gA		Open |vnicode://NamesList.txt| then jump to the character
		under the cursor.

["x]g8		Similar to |g8|.

		When used on a named register it is filled with |&filetype|
		specific escape sequence.

==============================================================================
COMMANDS
							*vnicode-commands*
							*:Unicode*
:Unicode |vnicode-CODEPOINTS|
		Show Unicode information about specified codepoints.

							*:UTF8*
:UTF8 |vnicode-CODEPOINTS|
		Show a |g8| like information about specified codepoints.

							*:VnicodeUpdate*
:VnicodeUpdate [target]...
		Run Makefile (at the plugin source root) with the specified
		arguments. Default target is "update" that updates
		(redownloads) all required data files.

		NOTE: Plugin does not perform automatic updates; it have to be
		done manually.


							*vnicode-CODEPOINTS*
Above commands can take codepoints in multiple formats.

/* Take codepoint from under the cursor. */
CODEPOINTS := /* epsilon */
CODEPOINTS := [ "\" ] "0" [ "o" ] OCT
CODEPOINTS := DEC
CODEPOINTS := "U" [ "+" ] HEX
CODEPOINTS := [ "0" | "\" ] "x" HEX
CODEPOINTS := [ "'" | '"' ] [CHARACTER]... [ "'" | '"' ]

==============================================================================
DATA FILES
							*vnicode-datafiles*
							*g:vnicode_datadir*
Some features require Unicode data files to be present under the data
directory specified by |g:vnicode_datadir| (default: `/path/to/plugin/data`).

These data files can be populated manually or can be managed in a more
convenient way using |:VnicodeUpdate|.

							*vnicode://*
|vnicode://|{PATH} reads file at |g:vnicode_datadir|/{PATH}.

						*vnicode://NamesList.txt*
Followings are specific to buffer |vnicode://NamesList.txt|.

Various mappings provided for easy navigation and editing. See
`:nmap <buffer>` for the complete list.

:Codepoint [{CHARACTER} | {HEX}]			*:Codepoint*
		Jump to the the specified character or codepoint. If no
		arguments given, move with |CTRL-w_w| and get codepoint under
		the cursor.

|:Codepoint| also used as 'keywordprg' so |K| can be used for quick jumping.
